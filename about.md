## Who am I?

I am a passionate young programmer with experience using Game Engines, such as Unity or Unreal Engine 4. Also experienced in 3D real-time rendering techniques. And a graphics programming lover.

Someone who is always aiming to improve, learning from the situation, and refining my skills day by day.

A fun-loving programmer, that enjoys what he does, but if is on a team, always better. Because to go further, we need to go together. And working on a team, with different point of views, is the best way to learn from others.

## What have I done?

Well, I started recently, so I have not done too much, but what I have done, I am proud of it. Currently, my work is available on my [blog](http://unyankee.github.io/).

Easy acces, currently hosted on Github pages: 
<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>



I really love graphics programming, what can be done, is fascinating. I started in my last year, a 3D Game Engine, called Alesal. It was my first attempt with a partner, trying  OpenGL, and since then, my passion for APIâ€™s and different rendering techniques have been constantly evolving.


Researching for different real-time rendering pipelines, different optimizations, well, there is a whole bunch of things to do :)


## Currently doing

Currently working as a Graphics Programmer on Creative Assembly

In my spare time I am developing my toy engine, while learning vulkan.
