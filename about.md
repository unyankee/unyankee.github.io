## Who am I?

 I am a young programmer, who always wanted to know how everything was made. I obtained my HND in Computing & Systems Development, at ESAT, and then I got the chance to study abroad on Sheffield, where I got the top mark in the year!!

 Currently I am working as associate graphics programmer on Creative Assembly.


## What have I done?

Well, I started recently, so I have not done too much, but what I have done, I am proud of it. Currently, my work is available on my [blog](http://unyankee.github.io/).

Easy acces, currently hosted on Github pages: 
<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>



I really love graphics programming, what can be done, is fascinating. I started in my last year, a 3D Game Engine, called Alesal. It was my first attempt with a partner, trying  OpenGL, and since then, my passion for APIâ€™s and different rendering techniques have been constantly evolving.


Researching for different real-time rendering pipelines, different optimizations, well, there is a whole bunch of things to do :)


## Currently doing

Currently working as Associate Graphics Programmer on Creative Assembly


> My first Open Source project, hosted on GitHub, a WIP 3D Game Engine called OutterSpace, that currently is not available, but I plan to make it public as soon as I get something I can feel proud of : )
It will be my toy game engine to test everything I am interested on


<!-- I am really excited about it, and can not wait to see how it end up looking!  -->
