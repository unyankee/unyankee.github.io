## Who am I?

I am a young programmer, who always wanted to know how everything was made.
I obtained my HND in Computing & Systems Development, at [ESAT](http://www.esat.es/).

Currently studying abroad, at Sheffield Hallam University, where I expect to get my BSc(honours).

I am looking for working on the industry, I really would like to, and meet new people 
with the same feelings about games than me. It would be completely awesome to work on a passione team.

## What have I done?

Well, I started recently, so I have not done too much, but what I have done, I am proud of it.
Currently my work is avaliable at my [blog](http://unyankee.github.io/).

Easy acces, currently hosted on Github pages: 
<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>



I really love graphics programming, what can be done, is fascinating.
I started on my last year, a 3D Game Engine, called Alesal, you can find [here](https://unyankee.github.io/2018/06/15/Alesal.html).
It was my first attempt with a partner, trying raw OpenGL, and since then, my passion for API's and different rendering techniques 
has been constanly evolving.

Researching for diffent realtime rendering pipelines, different optimizations, well, there is a whole bunch of things to do :)


## Currently doing

Well, currently doing a lot of things, but, the most important are two of them:

> My first Open Source project, hosted on GitHub, a WIP 3D Game Engine called OutterSpace.

 I will use to test all the tings I could on my free time, but it will be used as well for another subject.

> I new game aiming for the PS4, for a subject, that I still can not say anything about

On a team, where we can show what we can do, and having the possibility of working on a devKit, so that means extra researching, what 
sounds awesome!! 

I am really excited for both of them, and can not wait to see how the end up looking !

As you could notice, I am really excited for working on they industry, with more people.

>> We can go further, if we work together.
