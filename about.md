## Who am I?

I am a passionate and self-driven Senior Graphics Programmer with hands-on experience in real-time rendering, shader development, and game engines. My love for graphics programming fuels my curiosity, and I’m constantly experimenting with cutting-edge rendering techniques through personal projects. I am always striving to improve, learning from every challenge and refining my skills along the way.  

I also double as a GFX/Tools programmer, for those tools that might benefit from the GPU

In addition to my technical expertise, I thrive in collaborative environments. I believe teamwork, with its diverse perspectives, is key to pushing creative boundaries and achieving remarkable results. I enjoy working alongside others, as it allows for mutual learning and enables us to overcome complex visual challenges together.  

I am excited by the opportunity to contribute to innovative game development and help push the boundaries of visual storytelling. I would love to bring my skills and enthusiasm to your team and work towards creating visually stunning experiences.  

## What have I done?


I love graphics programming, what can be done, is fascinating. I started in my last year, a 3D Game Engine, called Alesal. It was my first attempt with a partner, trying  OpenGL, and since then, my passion for API’s and different rendering techniques have been constantly evolving.

Researching for different real-time rendering pipelines, and different optimizations, well, there are a whole bunch of things to do :)

<!-- I am really excited about it, and can not wait to see how it end up looking!  -->
