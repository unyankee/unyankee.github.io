## Who am I?

 I am a young programmer, who always wanted to know how everything was made. I obtained my HND in Computing & Systems Development, at ESAT, and then I got the chance to study abroad on Sheffield, where I got the top mark of the year.

 Currently I am working as a trainee graphics programmer on Creative Assembly.


## What have I done?

Well, I started recently, so I have not done too much, but what I have done, I am proud of it. Currently, my work is available on my [blog](http://unyankee.github.io/).

Easy acces, currently hosted on Github pages: 
<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>



I really love graphics programming, what can be done, is fascinating. I started in my last year, a 3D Game Engine, called Alesal, you can find here. It was my first attempt with a partner, trying raw OpenGL, and since then, my passion for APIâ€™s and different rendering techniques have been constantly evolving.


Researching for different real-time rendering pipelines, different optimizations, well, there is a whole bunch of things to do :)


## Currently doing

Well, currently doing a lot of things, but, the most important are two of them:

> My first Open Source project, hosted on GitHub, a WIP 3D Game Engine called OutterSpace.

 I will use it to test all the things I could on my free time, so some times it might be like a chaos :)

<!-- > A new game aiming for the PS4, for a subject, that I still can not say anything about :)

On a team, where we can show what we can do, and having the possibility of working on a devKit, so that means extra researching, what sounds awesome!!
-->


<!-- I am really excited for both of them, and can not wait to see how the end up looking!  -->



  >  We can go further if we work together.
