## Context

A small test game, developed with some special constraints, only is possible to use both thumbsticks of the controller, and play with a friend
is a must. So I wanted to try if a fast game, based on launching the enemy as far as possible to avoid him to do the same with you, was possible and
more important, if it was fun to play, or could evoke this emotion of defeating the enemy, and just play for it.
