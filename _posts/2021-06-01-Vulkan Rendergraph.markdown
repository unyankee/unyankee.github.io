# Introduction

Currently, I am busy with other experiments, but the plan is to continue working on this once I am done with my current project (taking profit of my free time to develop a tiny game in ue5 before going back to raw Vulkan).  
This will follow the fantastic book "Mastering Graphics Programming with Vulkan" by Gabriel Sassone and Marco Castorina
