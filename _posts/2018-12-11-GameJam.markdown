My first GameJam, I had just 1 day to produce a game, in fact, I had 2 days, but my pc stopped working, so meanwhile
it was fixed, I was drawing a small concept with my father, and what is better, the game was about fixing things !!!

In fact, is a small game, that is played using the screens that are in front all the time, just moving different cameras, and clicking
on any broken TV component, and the right person to fix that, so I started to draw this scenario on papers, by the time I had my pc back, could start
testing the idea.
Was a curious experience I'd be glad to repeat.
