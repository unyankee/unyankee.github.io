This is going to be a long one, so I want to take my time to make sure all what I said is well explained.

I need to explain how I dealt with the acceleration structure on GPU, how is created on CPU, and several different things, like avoiding primary rays for shadowing using custom G-Buffers.

So, all the information will be added as soon I complete my whole task, and as soon I can double ched everything is correct.

Thanks for waiting :)
