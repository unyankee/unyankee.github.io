## Context

BeerEmUp is my final year project at [ESAT Valencia]((https://www.esat.es/)), where I completed my HND.

Well it was not just me, we were a group of programmers, that with the help of our excellent artists from the same centre,
and a bunch of awesome musicians from [Berklee Valencia](https://valencia.berklee.edu/),  could develope our first project.
And the most exciting part, about finishing it, was that we had the opportinuty to publish our game on Steam.

[BeerEmUp](https://store.steampowered.com/app/945880/Beerem_Up/) is on Steam, a free to play game, so anyone could give it a chance.

situations, from dodging the rubble of buildings that collapse in its path, to escaping giant
rolling grapes in the purest Indiana Jones style.

player.

enemies at a stroke.

by enemies, rolling trunks invoked, and a long etc ...
The progression of the game is carried out through the advance and close combat,
