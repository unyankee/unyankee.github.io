## Who Am I?


I am a passionate young programmer with experience using Game Engines, such as Unity or Unreal Engine 4. Also experienced in 3D real-time rendering techniques. And a graphics programming lover.



Someone who is always aiming to improve, learning from the situation, and refining  my skills day by day.


A fun-loving programmer, that enjoys what he does, but if is on a team, always better. Because to go further, we need to go together.
And working on a team, with different point of views, is the best way to learn from others.
